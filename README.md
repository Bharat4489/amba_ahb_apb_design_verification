# amba_ahb_apb_design_verification
This project implements a complete AMBA system bus architecture, including a multi-master AHB subsystem, an AHB-to-APB bridge, and a set of APB peripherals. It features full synthesizable RTL, protocol-accurate behavior and a UVM testbench with CR tests, coverage, assertions, and A SB for end-to-end functional verification.
